      Right now, the scatter plot is just a cloud of blue dots,
      indistinguishable from each other. Let's change this. Wouldn't it be nice
      if the size of the dots corresponds to the population? To accomplish this,
      there is a list pop loaded in your workspace. It contains population
      numbers for each country expressed in millions. You can see that this list
      is added to the scatter method, as the argument s, for size.
